This project was developed during a course I took on React Fundamentals. The course covered key concepts such as componentization, props, state, and immutability, along with React Hooks for managing lifecycles and side effects. Additionally, I worked with TypeScript, adding static typing to improve code quality and maintainability. This training has enhanced my ability to create efficient and scalable React applications.

This application was developed using React, TypeScript, Vite, and CSS Modules. It consists of the timeline of a social network, where it is possible to create posts, add comments, delete comments, and like posts.
